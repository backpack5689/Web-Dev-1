<h2>What have they done?</h2>
<p>Imagine Dragons have done a lot of albums in the past, and the following are the 3 of my favorite albums.</p>
<dl>
	<dt><strong>Origins</strong></dt>
		<dd>Origins, being the newest on this list, definetly brings some great songs together under one album name. This<br>
		    album has a lot of great songs with the same kind of vibe. It also includes zero from the new motion picture <br>
			&quotRalph Breaks the Internet&quot. All in all, you can't go wrong with this album!
		</dd>
	<dt><strong>Night Visions</strong></dt>
		<dd>This is the oldest album that they have on this list, releasing in 2012. However, if you don't have it in your <br>
			library already, that just makes it an even bigger issue! This album has great songs like the super popular song<br>
			&quotRadioactive&quot, and some hidden gems like &quotBleeding Out&quot and &quotDemons&quot. By far my favorite<br>
			album, you should definetly go out and buy this album!		
		</dd>
	<dt><strong>Smoke + Mirrors</strong></dt>
		<dd>This is my third favorite album, and for good reason. The music in this album just really forces someone to have<br>
			to think about their situation, while being super catchy. They all just hold so much meaning, and not just for the<br>
			authors as well. &quotShots&quot, &quotI Bet my Life&quot, and &quotI'm so Sorry&quot have all helped me get through<br>
			things that has happend in my life. All in all, a great album filled to the brim with meaning!		
		</dd>

<p>The group has also gone on to create so many beautiful works of art, but these are just 3 of the many albums that I think should<br>
	be in everyones iTunes account. Speaking of...

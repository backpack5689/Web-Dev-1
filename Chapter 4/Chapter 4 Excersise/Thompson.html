	<h3>Video Games</h3>
	<p>I am a huge fan of videogames. I play a whole bunch of different ones, from the Nintendo Switch to the PC. However, my top 3 are probably
		Super Smash Brothers Ultimate, Stardew Valley, and Starcraft II</p>
	<h3>Watching NCIS</h3>
	<p>This is pretty self explanatory. I just really enjoy watching NCIS. I am on the last season sadly</p>
	<h3>Doing Woodworking</h3>
	<p>I really enjoy doing woodworking. My latest project was building a clock for my bible project (as seen below). It was a lot of fun, especially
		for it being my first clock. It was a lot of fun, and I would reccomend everyone trying it at least once.</p>

	<h3>Competing in Programming Competitons</h3>
	<p>I really enjoy competing in the programming competitions. They are always a lot of fun to do with my friends. I typically program in Java, but
		I am currently also trying to get back into python at the moment.</p>
